## Abstract

This project focuses on designing a **RISC-V SoC** integrated with a **SIB Neuromorphic Accelerator** for **small-scale Spiking Neural Network (SNN) applications**. The **RISC-V processor** manages the accelerator to enable **low-power, low-latency edge computing**. This system is aimed at providing efficient, real-time AI capabilities for embedded systems and edge devices, ideal for neuromorphic processing.
