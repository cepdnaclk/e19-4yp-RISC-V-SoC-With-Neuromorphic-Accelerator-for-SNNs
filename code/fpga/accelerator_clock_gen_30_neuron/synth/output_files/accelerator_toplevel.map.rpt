    Info: Processing started: Sat Jan 11 13:54:46 2025
Info: Command: quartus_map --read_settings_files=on --write_settings_files=off accelerator_toplevel -c accelerator_toplevel
Critical Warning (138067): Current license file does not support incremental compilation. The Quartus II software removes all the user-specified design partitions in the design automatically.
Info (11104): Parallel Compilation has detected 8 hyper-threaded processors. However, the extra hyper-threaded processors will not be used by default. Parallel Compilation will use 4 of the 4 physical processors detected instead.
